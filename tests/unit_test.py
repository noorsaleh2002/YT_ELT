# """
# Going back to the unit test Python script, first we create the function which as we said, needs to

# start with test underscore and then give it an appropriate name which is API underscore key.

# This function will need to take as argument the API underscore key fixture we defined in the conf test.py.

# So let's start by writing test underscore API underscore key which takes API underscore key argument.

# Then to verify the API key, we simply use the Python assert keyword to test if API underscore key is

# in fact equal to what we defined in the fixture, which should be mock underscore key 1234.

# Before we check if the test passes or fails.

# A quick note that I want to add is that apart from naming conventions for functions, Pytest also has

# naming conventions for the script names.

# So we name the script unit underscore test because Pytest requires that the Python script starts with

# test underscore or ends in underscore test.

# And here we are using the latter letter syntax.

# So going back to the results of our test.

# Let's go inside one of the airflow containers.

# Here we already are inside the airflow worker container.

# And let's run our test.

# So we write Pytest dash v.

# We use the dash v for a more verbose output, and then we define the path of where the unit test script

# is, which is tests unit underscore test py for now.

# To run this script, it would give the output for the single function.

# However, we will continue to build more tests.

# So to specify a particular function we use the dash k option with the function name.

# Let's run it.
